# Random Number Guessing Game

Simple command line application that starts a random number guessing game. Numbers will be 1 to 100.

Project idea is from the [Python Tech Degree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/python-web-development), but is built
with Java.

## Description

The player will need to guess a number between 1 and 100. Invalid responses or guesses outside of that range will not be accepted. The number of tries taken to find the number is told to the player, and a high score of lowest tries is kept as long as the application is running.

Player can exit the game at any point by typing "q" or "quit".
